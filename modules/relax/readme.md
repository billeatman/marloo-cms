INSTRUCTIONS
============

Just drop into your **modules** folder or use the box-cli to install

`box install relax`

## Settings
You will need to update the your `ColdBox.cfc` with a `relax` structure with your preferred settings for Relax.  
 
```
relax = {
    // The location of the relaxed APIs, defaults to models.resources
    APILocation = "modules.relax.models.resources",
    // Default API to load, name of the directory inside of resources
    defaultAPI = "myapi",
    // History stack size, the number of history items to track in the RelaxURL
    maxHistory = 10
};
```

## Modeling
You can look at the samples inside of this module under the `models/resources` directory.  To start you can copy the `Relax.cfc` into your own project folder and then start spicing up the API via the RelaxDSL methods.

>"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the 
Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ." Romans 5:5
